# Search and Switch Containers

Search for containers and switch to them using the omnibox API.

This is a fork of [andreicristianpetcu/Search-and-Switch-Containers](https://github.com/andreicristianpetcu/Search-and-Switch-Containers)

To use, type `-co` and a part of the name of the container you want to switch to into the URL bar (`-co perso`). This addon will switch the current container to that container.

It uses basic fuzzy match/search - the characters have to be in the same order. (`-co fb` -> `Facebook` container).
